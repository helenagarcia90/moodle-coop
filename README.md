# Moodle Coop - Moodle for cooperation projects

## Project description

This is a Moodle 2.X platform modification originally created for a collaboration with l'École Superieure d'Informatique de Bobo-Dioulasso and then it has been generalized to be used for every organization that wants to.

It has been forked, modified, adapted and integrated in these **cooperation projects**:
* Cooperation project between Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC) and École Superieure d'Informatique de Bobo-Dioulasso (ESI, Burkina Faso) --> see: https://github.com/helenagarcia90/moodle-esi
* Cooperation project between Ocularis Associació (www.ocularis.ong) and Université Cheikh Anta Diop de Dakar (UCAD, à l'Hôpital Abass N'Dao) --> see: https://github.com/helenagarcia90/moodle-29 and http://ocularis-senegal.org/moodle/
* Cooperation project between Ocularis Associació (www.ocularis.ong) and Faculdade de Ciencias da Salude - Universidade de LÚRIO (FCS-UNILURIO) to help the creation of the first course of Pediatric Optometry Postgrade in all the African continent--> see: https://github.com/helenagarcia90/moodle-unilurio, https://unilurio.ocularis.ong/ and “20190417 Convenio FCS-UNILURIO.pdf”

The **main changes/features** are the following:

* UI simplification, by creating a personalized theme which priorizes cleanliness and easy site navigation. 
* UX improvement, by reducing more used functionallity steps and adding buttons and other easy ways to move through the site.
* "Template course" local module added. It simplifies the course creation by adding a more abstract layer above the courses. 

A template course is like a subject structure, only with the skeleton, description and main resources, but without evaluations, dates and any student realted to it. Then, it is possible to instance a course through a template course, just adding an initial and ending date. Then, it looks like a normal moodle course.
