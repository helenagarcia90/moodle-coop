# Moodle Cooperation V1

## Description

This Moodle platform was originally modified for a collaboration with l'Ã‰cole Superieure d'Informatique de Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso).

The main features are the following:

* UI simplification, by creating a personalized theme which priorizes cleanliness and easy site navigation.
* UX improvement, by reducing more used functionallity steps and adding buttons and other easy ways to move through the site.
* "Template course" local module added. It simplifies the course creation by adding a more abstract layer above the courses.

A template course is like a subject structure, only with the skeleton, description and main resources, but without evaluations, dates and any student realted to it. Then, it is possible to instance a course through a template course, just adding an initial and ending date. Then, it looks like a normal moodle course.
